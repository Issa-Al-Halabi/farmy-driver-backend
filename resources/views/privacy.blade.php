<p> Laravel also provides a mechanism for invalidating and "logging out" a user's
    sessions that are active on other devices without invalidating the session on
    3 their current device. This feature is typically utilized when a user is changing
    or updating their password and you would like t
    o invalidate sessions on other devices while keeping the current device authenticated.
